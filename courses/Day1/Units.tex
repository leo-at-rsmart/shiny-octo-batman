\subsubsection*{Credentials}
\begin{description}
\item [User Account] is \textbf{rice} with the password
  \textbf{rice}. This is used to unlock the VM after it has suspended,
  gone to sleep, or locked. The password is also required for
  executing commands as \textbf{root} which may on occassion be
  required. The user account home directory is located at
  \textbf{/home/rice} and will frequently be referred to during the training.
\item [Database Account] uses the jdbc connection string
  \textbf{jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kuldemo} and the
  username/password \textbf{kuldemo}/\textbf{kuldemo}. These are the
  default credentials and database connection information as defined
  in kul-cfg-dbs.
